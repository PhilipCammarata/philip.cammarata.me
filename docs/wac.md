# Windows Admin Center

I'm a big fan of the [Windows Admin Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/windows-admin-center) (WAC).  Being able to work within my lab environment without having to have a specific operating system or set of tools installed is a boon to my productivity.

I often reinstall operating systems in my lab so this is a script I've developed to download, install and configure WAC quickly.
