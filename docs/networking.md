# Networking

I love both networking hardware and software.  Firmware, protocols, appliances, I collect it all.

## OpenWRT

[OpenWRT](https://openwrt.org/) is probably my favorite networking firmware.  Awesome packages which can turn relatively simple pieces of equipment into very complex routing platforms.

The below devices I have either successfully installed OpenWRT, partially succeeded in installing OpenWRT or really wish I could install OpenWRT.

## [MikroTik RB5009](https://mikrotik.com/product/rb5009upr_s_in)

This is a great piece of hardare, PoE+ ports with cycles to spare but unfortunately OpenWRT isn't *quite* compatible but that seems [to be changing](https://github.com/Arie/openwrt-rb5009)

## [MikroTik hEX S](https://mikrotik.com/product/hex_s)

Works flawlessly with OpenWRT and has hardware flow offloading.

* [Ubiquiti Access Point U6 Long-Range](https://store.ui.com/products/u6-lr-us)

I was able to get the firmware to flash but during high load it will randomly reboot.  Working on that cause the Unifi 6 LR is great otherwise.

* [Netgate SG-3100](http://www.netgate.com/blog/introducing-sg-3100-appliance)

Can't flash it unfortunately.  pfSense was my first foray into the networking outside of just configuring a Linksys GUI.
