# Hyper-V Lab

My home lab consistats of a single [Hyper-V Server 2019](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-hyper-v-server-2019) hosted on an old MacMini.

I tend to work on a project or learn a skill and then wipe my environment so I can start fresh on something new which means I reinstall operating systems a lot.

This is my post-install script I run when I first boot my Hyper-V server.

## Post-install Script 

``` powershell
--8<-- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilipCammarata/scripts/main/lab_postinstall.ps1"
```
