# Hyper-V Lab

My home lab consistats of a single [Hyper-V Server 2019](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-hyper-v-server-2019) hosted on an old MacMini.

I try to script out every action I possibly can to keep my work repeatable and maintain a history of my actions.  These scripts represent some of that work.

## PowerShell Scripts

``` powershell title="New-MSSAVM"
--8<-- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilipCammarata/scripts/main/new-mssavm.ps1"
```

``` powershell title="Invoke-PostInstall"
--8<-- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilipCammarata/scripts/main/invoke-postinstall.ps1"
```
